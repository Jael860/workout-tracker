# Workout Tracker

This is a small app (still unfinished) to help keep track of your workout sessions in the gym. The idea
is to be able to create a workout program (like 8-12 weeks) and be able to keep track of your progress, plus it should
also automatically increase the amount of weight to be use in each exercise as you progress.

The main reason to do this project was to learn the basics of React Native and app development in general. 
This was part of the Fall 2020 version of CodeWithFriends (https://codewithfriends.io/)

Currently it is only implemented the main screen, whose design was grabbed from https://dribbble.com/shots/6552498-Workout-Tracker-App and
there is no intention of using this design commercially.
